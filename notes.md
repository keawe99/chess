# My Notes

Week 1

I have currently implemented the logic for the chess pieces to reflect a proper chess board with its respective parts. In addition, I have implemented the movement logic so that each piece moves according to the rules of the game.

Week 2

My goal is to now implement the logic for an actual chess game to be played. I must implement methods to impersonate each piece according to their proper movements and placement on the board.

Just so you know, I have copied and pasted the code for the CS 240 practice file in to chat to give me chessmove.java. If there are errors with how that works that is most likely the reason.
