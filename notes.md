# My Notes

Week 1

I have currently implemented the logic for the chess pieces to reflect a proper chess board with its respective parts. In addition, I have implemented the movement logic so that each piece moves according to the rules of the game.

Week 2

My goal is to now implement the logic for an actual chess game to be played. I must implement methods to impersonate each piece according to their proper movements and placement on the board.
